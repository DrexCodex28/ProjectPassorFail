<b> Food security </b>is an evolving concept where it is used widely across disciplines and issue areas. In general, the absence of food security – or the prevalence of food in security – is qualified by the presence of hunger and malnourishment. According to McDonalds (2010), it is commonly associated with the availability of food to meet the demand and the people’s access to food at the local, national and global levels.
The first official definition emerged in the 1974 United Nations World Food Conference where it states that food security meant “the availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in productions and prices.” The focus of the definition of food availability and supply was heavily influenced by the experience of a global food price crisis in 1972-1973, precipitated by adverse weather events that caused a shortage of staples like rice, wheat and grains, which caused the prices to increase drastically.
Food security is closely associated with human security as it prioritizes the safety of every human and communities from different threats. It calls for governments, international institutions and other actors to broaden their approach regarding this by acknowledging and addressing in a holistic and integrated manner, threats to both freedom from fear and freedom from want. 
i.	According to the UNDP, this means: First, safety from such chronic threats such as hunger, disease and repression and;
ii.	Second, protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions in the patterns of daily life – whether in homes, in jobs or in communities.
As such, they see hunger as the gravest threat towards food security. </p>
