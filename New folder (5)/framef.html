Globalization is comprised of significant social processes, specifically economic, political, and narrow-minded intentions. Economic involvement focused on the monetary aspect of global opportunity, thus wanting to maintain power and control at all costs through political pull; not caring about the situation or effect on their audience. In the Philippines, it is true that journalists are killed for attempting to expose corrupt activities, even the bribery. The desperation of both the government to censor information and the public for remaining in poverty results in both parties clashing. Another narrow-minded intention is seeking equality in an unfair world. Globalization attempted to make reseources available to everyone. In the Philippines, many find it difficult to buy food everyday yet most of them own a phone. The momentary pleasures help them ignore the harsh realities. Whatever intention globalization is given, it results in benefiting one social architype while taking form another. 

Media is essential in the implementation of globalization, for history could not be recorded. Human desire the imagined community, therefore it lead to a string of events, bringing us to the technological advancement we are currently enjoying. Imagine, all the information you could ever need sits in the palm of your hands, on a blue light subservient to one’s every command. This was not possible some hundred years ago. We are living in the age of information, where innovation is at its fastest. Filipinos are developing international skills despite never setting foot outside the country. They become desirable workforce for foreign countries, taking Pinoy Pride as outsourced labor. Many Filipinos abroad contribute to globalization by simply being themselves. They spread the culture, letting foreigners know of the typical Filipino traits: hospitality, respect, tolerance, and optimism. The jobs our fellow take such as Nursing and Computer Engineering exemplify in showcasing these typical talents.

Music is a cultural media and preserver. It serves as an alternative means of expression during the period of information restrictions to maintain political power and control. Music fills in the gaps of history, narrating human experiences from times of yore. Filipinos with their innate skill of singing frequent the karaoke bars singing a wide variety of songs. It is their preferred social leisure, wherein the enjoy what they are doing, relate to the message of the song, and interpret the user’s experience form a metaphorical and literal standpoint. They are able to indulge in foreign entertainment despite not knowing the language, because music has high production value, making it an auditory counterpart to reading.

Globalization, media, and history are intertwined because globalization can be paired with other concepts as well, but its connection with these terms prove the most significant. Everything never could have happened if people chose to keep things the way they are. Whether it be for better or worse remains an unanswered question. Glocalization takes place often in the Philipines, like the debut song of Ex Battalion called “ Hayaan mo Sila” was inspired from another worldwide hit entitled “ I’m the One” by DJ Khaled. Local entertainemnt also sought out to remake popular Korean dramas, beyond english subtitles and dubbing. 

Indeed, the interrelatedness of the concepts proves the unity of people all over the world. Systems may remain unchanged and unfair and all nations will never fall under one culture, but that is what makes globalization interesting. The struggle to relay information under alternative intent allows continuous growth in hopes of a better tomorrow. This determination allows innovation to progress along with the everlasting existence of humanity. If ever the human race dies out, our legacy will be recorded in the music, texts, and technology that would outlast lifetimes.
Religion was expected to die down, as if it were a trend. Its appeal to one’s belief allows the group to influence the individual on a deeper level, thus persisting to exist in modern day. Their scope broadened over the centuries. Religion as given itself a purpose- to critique the moral status of governments. The placeholders of power did not take these critiques seriously until mass destruction occurred. They created chaos by targeting liberalist countries such as America and Europe, the typical example being 9/11.
 From shootings in Afghanistan being a transnational problem to news of Islam activity being broadcasted on international news caused fear of the states. They made themselves known worldwide, making it clear what they stand for. The means it took for these activitists to gain influence, especially terrorism, seem contradictory to their own values or are twisted in favor of bloodshed. Extreme nazism is used to stereotype anyone not of the same religion. The rise of highly organized crime between religious activists enabled 9/11, and it does not stop there. With the innovation in technology, international news spreads quicker and easier. Anyone can be a reporter, but only few are skilled to earn the title. Religious activists take advantage of this advancement by uploading threat videos.
The most recent religious war in the Philippines is the one in Marawi. It left the land devastated and uninhabitable. It has been investigated that it was strategized by the Philippine ISIS. Many lost their lives in that war due to friction between muslim and christian beliefs.
In short, religion gained influence and power through propaganda and manslaughter, under the guise of promoting true sacramental value. They may say they work in line with what the divine beings want, but terrorism is an act that can make one question morality itself. Is it really worth it to promote righteous values if the means to gaining influence goes against what they stand for?
