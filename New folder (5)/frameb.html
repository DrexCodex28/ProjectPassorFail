<b> Globalization </b> is a widely discussed topic. It is all that easy to explain such a complicated term in simple words. One might think globalization started in recent years, but really international trade has been influencing changes across borders for centuries. Silk and spice trade routes through East Asia, that began as early as the 1st Century BCE, introduced different cultures and linked the economics of different nations. Wider influence prospered with the English and Dutch shipping empires in the 16th century.
<br/>
<i> Definition </i> <br/>
Globalization comes from globe, that means the worldwide coming together of countries and nations. It is a process and a condition that involves increasing interconnectedness of different parts of the world through common processes of economic, environmental, political, cultural change (Knox, Marton, Nash, 2010).
Globalization is also a social process where people become more and more aware of other civilizations and societies across geographical, political, and social borders. The economic independence of different countries as well as advancements in communication technology and the progress of technology in general; have all contributed to globalization.
In general, globalization is the sharing of culture, money, and products between countries that is happening because of international trade advances in transportation and communication.
<br/>
<i> Effects </i> <br/>
Advances in technology, such as mobile phones, airplanes, telephones and the internet, have made the growth of transport and communication networks possible. Amongst other things, this means that people and countries can exchange information and goods more quickly and in a less complicated way. The tremendous growth of international trade over the past several decades has been both a primary cause and effect of globalization. The volume of world trade increased twenty-seven fold from $296 billion in 1950 to $8 trillion in 2005 (WTO, 2007 para 1) Domestic manufacturers produce more efficiently due to their international specialization ( Williams and Rojas, Globalization on Industry, 2011)
Spread of culture is also observed, primarily the spread of English language because it is the most popular language worldwide. It  is an official language in 52 countries as well as many small colonies and territories. In addition, ¼ to 1/3 of the people in the world understand and speak English to some degree (O’Neil, para 3,2011)
Increase in migration is also a result of globalization. In 2013, 232 million people or 3.2 percent of the world’s population were international migrants, compared with 175 million in 2000 and 154 million in 1990 (2013, para 12). The North, or developed countries, is home to 136 million international migrants, compared to 96 million in the South, or developing countries. Most international migrants are of working age (20 to 64 years) and account for 74 percent of the total (para 3).
<br/>
Distance is no longer a barrier as ideas could travel through Communication and Mass Media. Globalization connects people all over the world and it involves eliminating distance as a barrier in connecting people from different parts of the world. Foreign companies used to manufacture products in their home countries. Their products are in direct competition with each other, but both companies pay the same salaries and production costs. They have the same customers and similar suppliers and sell the same products at the same prices. In short, the same conditions apply to both companies.
<br/>
<i> Advantage </i> <br/>
Due to technical, cultural, and economic developments that have come about through globalization, other companies that manufacture products under different conditions can now offer their products in other countries too. That’s why a company in country B can sell TVs at a lower price, because they were produced for less. The local firms have to react to withstand the competition and so the world grows closer together and there is an active exchange of goods between countries. More affordable products are available for more people.

However, not only does an exchange of products and economic goods take place, but also of services, cultural goods and even language. All of these elements are closely linked and influence each other. Financial and industrial globalization is increasing substantially and is creating more opportunities for both industrialized and developing countries, the largest impact has been on developing countries, who now are able to attract foreign investors and foreign capital (Mohr, para 1).
Disadvantage
Because of globalization and its intense exchange of goods, people and the environment often suffer. For example, if the company decides to move production to an economically disadvantaged country, people in the industrialized countries lose jobs. At the same time, job opportunities open up to many locals in the economically disadvantaged countries. Many people in these countries work for very little money in comparison to those in industrialized countries. Therefore, they often remain poor and more often than not do not have sufficient insurance, social insurance, or health insurance cover.

A further disadvantage of globalization is ecological problems such as climate change. The use of airplanes, ships, and lorries to transport goods over international borders is constantly on the increase. This causes more carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere which in turn is the main cause of global warming. Even national environmental standards are ignored. This is a further cost factor in the worldwide international site competition, which should be kept as low as possible to be attractive for a company.
<br/> <i> 
Ethics  </i> <br/>
There are, therefore, many sides to globalization which affect almost all aspects of life, causing me to think that the chain of positive and negative effects will continue to grow further. What is important is to realize that globalization itself is neither good nor bad. It just depends how the people deal with all the new possibilities in the future.

Theories  </i> <br/>
World-Systems Theory
It focuses on the importance of the world as a unit rather than isolating individual countries. It divides the world to three regions: core countries, periphery countries, and semi-periphery countries.

Core countries include areas like Western Europe and the United States. These countries have a strong central government with enough sources of revenue to support development programs. These countries are economically diversified, industrialized, and relatively independent of outside control. They have strong middle and working classes and focus on a higher scope of production of material goods rather than just the processing of raw materials.

Periphery countries are those in Latin America and Africa; they tend to depend on only one type of economic activity, like extracting raw materials. Theses countries’ societies have a high percentage of poor and uneducated people as well as a small upper class which controls most of the country’s economy. As a result, this creates huge inequality in living standards among the population. These countries are greatly influenced by Core countries and transnational corporations, which can harm the future economic potentials of the periphery countries

Semi-periphery countries like India and Brazil make up the middle ground between Core and Periphery. They are not often dominant in international trade but they have a relatively diversified and developed economy. These Semi-Periphery countries can come either from Periphery countries moving up toward the status of industrialized Core countries or from Core countries declining toward Periphery status

The World-Systems Theory is a fluid model, but it is critical for being too focused on the economy and the Core countries, and forgetting about the culture or even the class struggles of individual countries.

Modernization Theory

Proposes that all countries follow a similar path of development from a traditional to a modern society. It assures that with some help, traditional countries can develop into modern countries in the same way that today’s modern countries developed in the first place. It looks like the internal social dynamics as the country adapts to new technologies then causes political and social changes respectively. 
Dependency Theory
Dependency Theory has a reaction to Modernization Theory and uses the idea of Core and Periphery countries from the World Systems Theory to address the inequalities between countries. Basically, it is the idea that Periphery or Third World countries are poor economically and export their resources to the wealthy Core or First World countries. This is not because the former are in an earlier stage of development but rather they are integrated into the World System as countries that are underdeveloped. They have their own social structures with features not seen in developed countries that does not allow them to accelerate growth to becoming highly-developed nations. They are in an unfavorable economic position; that means these countries do not even have the opportunity to improve and develop. They will remain poor and dependent on wealthier nations.

There are many other globalization theories that focus on culture or social networking, economy, politics, or even the production of material goods.

Perspectives
Hyperglobalist
The hyper-globalist perspective sees globalization as a legitimate process; new age in human history. Countries’ economies became interdependent as these nation states themselves become less important. The many individual countries congregate so becoming one global society, though theorists cannot agree whether this is good or bad
Skeptical
The skeptical perspective is critical of globalization and considers today’s international processes as becoming regionalized rather than globalized. Countries’ borders are becoming less important. Third World countries are not being integrated into the crux of the global economy neither enjoying the same benefits as First World countries. Skeptics do not believe that the current economic model is leading towards global capitalism; trans-national corporations are still tied to their home countries and national borders are more important now than ever.
Transformationalist
Transformationalist perspective does not have either a specific cause or a specific outcome. This belief is nationalist governments are changing perhaps becoming less important yet it is difficult to describe such changes so simply. As to the strong stance skeptics take on the marginalization of Third World countries, transformationalists again just see that the world is changing - into what specific patterns they are uncertain, just that a new world order design is developing. Similarly, there are many factors that influence the change in world patterns, but the outcomes of these changes are just not known.
Conclusion
To summarize, globalization created a world economy where different countries are interdependent on each other, promoting a global community. Not only was there an exchange of goods, but culture too, making people more and more aware of the global community. Too much globalization negatively affects the economy and ecology. Too little globalization causes gaps in knowledge and understanding. Nonetheless, it all originated from the human desire to spread information across the far ends of the globe.
