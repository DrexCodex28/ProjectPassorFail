<center><b> Globalization – Immigration </b></center>  <p align="justify">
	Immigration has been a major thing considered in globalization topics. Firstly, it is defined as people migrating from one country to the other; usually from their country of origin to another country of their choosing. 
	Immigration in the past was viewed with wonder and was uplifted by the drive for people to explore. Back then, it was a wonderful thing to be able to see what other people were like, to make new friends, and to find middle grounds where both sides could agree even if they held completely different views and lifestyles from one another. 
	Nowadays, immigration is viewed with more negatives than positives. The world as it is today has never been in a worse situation in all of history. One example can be seen in the United States in recent years: the exporting of their workforce and businesses has led to a poor economy where the people of the land are not able to gain as much benefits as they should. The same thing is happening in other countries: having people work abroad, while it does have its benefits, will in the long run, be a loss for the country. 
	Another effect of this is that migrants have better opportunities and are favored for working in a country over the country’s own people. This could be due to cheaper labor, or that migrant employees don’t need to be compensated for as much as locals. While this is good for the businesses themselves or the foreigners being hired, it is in the bigger picture, not very good for the host nation and its locals. For example, using America again, a product is manufactured in the U.S. The average consumer would have to pay an extra 5% for that product than the amount it was manufactured for. The labor would have been cheaper if it was outsourced, sure, but the reason it would be overall better for the product to be manufactured in the US because that means that the locals would have a job: in other words, they are able to afford that extra 5% and the host nation does not lose revenue. 
	Putting aside economics and business, immigration also has more negative connotations today. Another issue is an overflow of immigrants: in many nations, particularly in the West, the locals are becoming a minority in their own lands. A recent report in the U.K. has even stated that migrants from the Middle East own more land than the Queen herself. Migrant majorities who also hold a different belief from the local people are also being given more priority. 
	This especially holds true for the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants flowing into the borders of European nations. Both legal and illegal immigrants here tend to be refugees or those seeking asylum. The governments- specifically, the European Union, give large amounts of benefits, including free benefits which are unfair to the local people who work hard for their country. What’s more is that the migrants are able to dictate laws due to the privileges given to them by the EU. This has led to several criminal acts and violations of human rights, and this is mostly due to the religion that most of these immigrants hold: Islam. Though, that is a topic for another day.
	The advent of immigration has led to many changes- some pleasant, but some bad as well. While many cultures are able to exchange ideas with one another, this does not usually turn out well when some cultures simply cannot agree with each other. With the many issues of immigration today and the education system’s idea of “globalization,” it would be no wonder that such horrid statistics are appearing in the world today.
