Globalization is comprised of significant social processes, specifically economic, political, and narrow-minded intentions. Economic involvement focused on the monetary aspect of global opportunity, thus wanting to maintain power and control at all costs through political pull; not caring about the situation or effect on their audience. In the Philippines, it is true that journalists are killed for attempting to expose corrupt activities, even the bribery. The desperation of both the government to censor information and the public for remaining in poverty results in both parties clashing. Another narrow-minded intention is seeking equality in an unfair world. Globalization attempted to make reseources available to everyone. In the Philippines, many find it difficult to buy food everyday yet most of them own a phone. The momentary pleasures help them ignore the harsh realities. Whatever intention globalization is given, it results in benefiting one social architype while taking form another. 

Media is essential in the implementation of globalization, for history could not be recorded. Human desire the imagined community, therefore it lead to a string of events, bringing us to the technological advancement we are currently enjoying. Imagine, all the information you could ever need sits in the palm of your hands, on a blue light subservient to one’s every command. This was not possible some hundred years ago. We are living in the age of information, where innovation is at its fastest. Filipinos are developing international skills despite never setting foot outside the country. They become desirable workforce for foreign countries, taking Pinoy Pride as outsourced labor. Many Filipinos abroad contribute to globalization by simply being themselves. They spread the culture, letting foreigners know of the typical Filipino traits: hospitality, respect, tolerance, and optimism. The jobs our fellow take such as Nursing and Computer Engineering exemplify in showcasing these typical talents.

Music is a cultural media and preserver. It serves as an alternative means of expression during the period of information restrictions to maintain political power and control. Music fills in the gaps of history, narrating human experiences from times of yore. Filipinos with their innate skill of singing frequent the karaoke bars singing a wide variety of songs. It is their preferred social leisure, wherein the enjoy what they are doing, relate to the message of the song, and interpret the user’s experience form a metaphorical and literal standpoint. They are able to indulge in foreign entertainment despite not knowing the language, because music has high production value, making it an auditory counterpart to reading.

Globalization, media, and history are intertwined because globalization can be paired with other concepts as well, but its connection with these terms prove the most significant. Everything never could have happened if people chose to keep things the way
