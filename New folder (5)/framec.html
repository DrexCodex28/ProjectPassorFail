<b> <center> How to be a Citizen of the World  </center> </b> <br/><p align="justify">
There is only one Earth, and it is diverse. Different kinds of people live in different regions of the world, and they have made their homeland their own. Over the years, countries have built a reputation for themselves, building up their identity as homage to their ancestors. This has enticed foreigners to visit these places to see it for themselves. Tourism in recent years has expanded from historical relics to commissioned artworks that exemplify the local culture. Of course, pictures will be available online, but it cannot compare to actually being in the place. The experience is the main selling point.

Letâ€™s say you get the chance to travel to a far off place, either as a planned vacation, a required business trip, or as a prize from a random draw lot. If you want to make the most of your trip, there are three attitudes you need to adapt: <br/><br/>
1.	Be Prepared
It is a new place, so it would be best to have some knowledge about the destination beforehand. Search for places on the area where you can eat, sleep, and do some shopping.  Check reviews of these places to see if they are legitimate and reliable. You can also see the price range of these places online, so you can better manage your budget beforehand.

It would also be advisable to read up on the culture of the destination so you do not unknowingly embarrass yourself or offend the locals. Maybe read up on their law as well, as there have been cases of arresting tourists for breaking the rules which they had no prior knowledge of. The time you could be spending to roam around the area would instead go to serving jail time.

Most importantly, secure your personal items, especially your means to go back home. Extra cash on hand would never hurt, to anticipate unforseen mishaps. Be mindful to not leave your things unattended, because it would be hard to retrace your steps in a completely new land. <br/><br/>

2.	Be Interested

While you are there, get to know the place. It is an adventure! You could pay for a tour around the area, as they provide culturally- enriching commentary of the popular tourist spots. You could also explore around the destination by yourself if you are into self-discovery, just be smart and safe about it. Be wary of dangerous looking pathways and people. Safety is still priority our curiosity.

The best way to get to know the place is asking the locals. If there do not look dangerous as mentioned earlier, then feel free to be friendly! It is their homeland, so they know the place better. <br/><br/>

3.	Be inspired
So you have gained new experiences and a fresh perspective of a different part of the globe. You have seen new attractions and felt the company of new others. Alas, you must return to your homeland and get back into the fray. You would be leaving the destination with something irreplaceable- the memory of visiting, the experience.

It would be nice to preserve the memory of visiting the place. While you are there, you can buy local goods and support their industry. Smart marketing tactics used would be plastering the name of the place on a small, cheap, but noticeable item such as a keychain or clothing. Most novelty items are akin with tourism merchandise which in it of itself is a bizarre experience.

At but not least, spread the word! If you can post the greatness of the destination on social  media, why not. It is nice to spread happy memories, plus you would be giving exposure to the destination. You are like free promotion for the tourist attraction, and you can spark interests of viewers.

What will you do on your next travel?
